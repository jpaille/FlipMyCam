# Google Meet Mirror

Flip / unmirror Camera on Google Meet to match what other **really** see.

## Usage

Once the extension is activated the camera will be flipped. To toggle just click on the extension icon on the top right corner.

## Competition

- Google grid extension had the option to flip the camera but it's now broken because Google Meet has deployed its own grid system.
- VideoMirror extension mirror all videos in the room including shared screen. This is bad because the shared screen become unreadable, all is written in reverse !

## Supports

- Supports only Google Meet
